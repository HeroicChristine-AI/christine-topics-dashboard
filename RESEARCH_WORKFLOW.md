# Research Workflow - Updated for Quality

## Virality Criteria

Always check for these signals before including a topic:

1. **Minimum View Threshold**: 1000+ views required
   - Below 1000 = skip unless strong other virality signals exist

2. **Cross-Reference Trending**: Same topic appears in multiple searches = more likely viral
   - Ex: "Sora AI" appears in "AI tools", "AI controversy", "DeepSeek" = stronger signal

3. **Engagement Signals**: Look for comments, likes ratio, recent upload date
   - Fresh content (last 7 days) gets priority

4. **Topic Pattern Learning** (from 1of10.com):
   - Airless content angles work better than generic viral ideas
   - Specific aesthetics + clear value proposition > "just shocking"
   - Educational "how-to" formats outperform pure entertainment

## What Makes a Topic Actually Viral?

From 1of10.com analysis:
- True outliers: 6x+ channel average views
- Multiple appearance: Same video/topic shows up in different searches
- Recent: Uploaded within last 30 days
- Engagement: High comment activity, like ratio

## What to Avoid

- Generic "viral" videos with <1000 views
- Clickbait titles without substance
- Recycled content from 6+ months ago
- Topics that only appear once in search results
